Maison du Temple: Thub Thab

This exhibition is not meant for you to “understand everything” at once.
Aaitaam simply invites you to be with it — to walk, to rest, and to feel at your own pace.
You may sit, recline, or even lie down, as if you were inside an IKEA showroom.
Take photos, share them on social media, or keep them for yourself — as you wish.

This space is not designed to be viewed from afar,
but to be felt and experienced — as if you were at home —
through the six senses: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
The exhibition extends Aaitaam’s concept into a collaborative design process,
where the six sense doors are gently woven together,
allowing all perceptions to harmonize softly,
so that each visitor may feel according to their own conditions and causes.

The 32 collage works by Jesvyn Hirunkankosit (JESS) convey
faith and memory through the story of the Buddha’s life —
a delicate composition of Thai mural paintings, photographs,
and contemporary international elements, all set within vintage wooden frames.

Each room features a QR Code translated by Tan AI (TAN AI) into 16 languages,
enabling visitors from diverse cultures to experience the stories in their own language.

Finally, Aaitaam invites everyone to take their time in each room,
without trying to interpret — simply to observe, to feel,
and to be mindful in every present moment.
